              <p class = "blog-content">Officially halfway done with bootcamp! Last week was a whirlwind.  We started out with a pair project, working with the framework <a href="http://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and some APIs.  My partner and I worked on creating a chat app that allows the user to run a command when using the '@' or ampersand character. Long story short, we developed our chat app with some technical difficulties from Vue.js, so we ended up rebuilding it in jQuery. jQuery, I still love you. </p>
              <p class = "blog-content">This weekend, our cohort worked on a group project across the Front-End and Ruby on Rails classes.  This was my first introduction to rails and the rails asset pipeline.  Was it scary? You bet.  Was it frustrating? Absolutely.  Was it the most fun i've ever had on a project? 100% yes.  I was impressed with how well we planned, organized and deployed our first fullstack project.  Everyone in bootcamp is hardworking and has grit, but not everyone in the world can be empathetic or patient. Our group shined in all aspects. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0">Google</a>, we're coming for you!</p>

              <p class = "blog-content">A few weeks ago, I started bootcamp. Not a "bootcamp" in the traditional sense, but most definitely a bootcamp. For the past 5 weeks, The Iron Yard Academy has been my home, mostly because i've been all but slept here these past few weeks, but partly because these people end up becoming your fellow wonderfully nerdy, cat-meme loving family.  So what have I struggled through and what have I done so far?
              Well, let me put this in an unordered list for you. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>HTML: the skeleton, the king! I enjoy how literal it is.  It has been a great foray into coding and after a few weeks of practicing, I feel as though this hypertext markup language and I are now best friends.  I also enjoy using geolocation in HTML5 and one day I hope to feel the same for localStorage. One day.</li>
                  <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is both beautiful and beautifully hacky.  I enjoy making web pages centered, adding media queries in and looking at how responsive my work can be, and playing around with it's simpler but sleeker sister pre-processer, Sass.  We also looked into Twitter's popular framework, Bootstrap. Due to my time constraints, and the fact that I would like to get back to doing my assignment, I used Bootstrap to create this quick and easy blog in just a few minutes!</li>
                  <li>JavaScript: Ah, this is truly the heart of the course. We've become familiar with Vanilla JavaScript; from functions, methods and objects, arrays and loops, we
                  have practiced them all.  The daily coding challenges can be intimidating, but they are great practice. Then, we learned jQuery and wondered what we have been doing all our lives. jQuery, I love you.</li>
                </ul>
              <p> For those of you looking for some great resources for newbies, I highly recommend the following:</p>
