          <p class = "blog-content">A few weeks ago, I started bootcamp. Not a "bootcamp" in the traditional sense, but most definitely a bootcamp. For the past 5 weeks, The Iron Yard Academy has been my home, mostly because i've all but slept here these past few weeks, but partly because these people end up becoming your fellow wonderfully nerdy, cat-meme loving family.  So what have I struggled through and what have I done so far?
          Well, let me put this in an unordered list for you. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>HTML: the skeleton, the king! I enjoy how literal it is.  It has been a great foray into coding and after a few weeks of practicing, I feel as though this hypertext markup language and I are now best friends.  I also enjoy using geolocation in HTML5 and one day I hope to feel the same for localStorage. One day.</li>
              <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is both beautiful and beautifully hacky.  I enjoy making web pages centered, adding media queries in and looking at how responsive my work can be, and playing around with it's simpler but sleeker sister, the pre-processer, Sass.  We also looked into Twitter's popular framework, Bootstrap. Due to my time constraints, and the fact that I would like to get back to doing my assignment, I used Bootstrap to create this quick and easy blog in just a few minutes!</li>
              <li>JavaScript: Ah, this is truly the heart of the course. We've become familiar with Vanilla JavaScript; from functions, methods and objects, arrays and loops, we
              have practiced them all.  The daily coding challenges can be intimidating, but they are great practice. Then, we learned jQuery and wondered what we have been doing all our lives. jQuery, I love you.</li>
            </ul>
          <p> For those of you looking for some great resources for newbies, I highly recommend the following:</p>
