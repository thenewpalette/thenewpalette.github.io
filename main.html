        <small>4 May 2016</small>
        <p class = "blog-content">Twelve weeks flew by so quickly and it all culminated with a presentation night in front of 60+ The Iron Yard staff, employers, recruiters, friends and family.  During presentation night, a senior front-end developer asked me how my experience was during final projects, and I candidly admitted it was frustrating and fun.  I almost regretted saying that, but to be fair, that is how I truly felt.  The frustration of a difficult project does not outweigh the rewards; it is what fuels your passion and keeps you focused on hitting MVP.  The key is to have a positive outlook through all of it.  In the end, I was proud of what our team had built together.  After 2.5 weeks, we shipped our app, Rider.  We felt like developers. </p>

        <p class = "blog-content">Being a part of blended team of two front-end developers (including myself) and four rails developers was a great experience.  We all worked so well together, and each one of my teammates contributed greatly and left a lasting impression of the project.  I want to give a shout-out to the back-end team who worked hard to build the open source, fully documented API that we integrated, appropriately named “Farefairy."</p>

        <p class = "blog-content">Side note: Funny enough, my birthday fell on the date of our big presentation night.  One teammate, who I won’t name (but may or may not go by the name of Jefferson), brought in cupcakes to celebrate.  Did I mention I worked with the best team ever?</p>

        <p class = "blog-content">To view our presentation, click <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZz283c7z3I">here.</a>  For information about Rider and other projects, look <a href = "https://immense-woodland-18450.herokuapp.com/projects/index">here.</a></p>

        Now, I am off to finish my portfolio and do some refactoring.  I will update soon.  I hope your journey though bootcamp will be as rewarding and satisfying (or maybe even as frustrating) as mine.  It was the best decision I made.  Cheers! </p>

        <h2 class = "blog-title">Pitch Perfect</h2>
        <small>7 April 2016</small>
        <p class = "blog-content">Last week was our last week of lecture, and it ended with "Pitch Day" for final projects on Friday.  Many of our classmates prepared pitches for a website or app they were passionate about and would like to see in production.  The final project is a cross-collaboration project, consisting of a large team of Ruby on Rails developers and Front-End developers.  A fellow cohort member and I pitched "Rider" app together on Friday, and I am thrilled to say that it was picked. Our incredible team is now hard at work on making this concept a reality!  Being a team-lead is a big undertaking, but I couldn't be more humbled and excited about this opportunity. </p>
        <p class = "blog-content"> Our first sprint ran from this past Monday to today, and in just a few short days we were able to hit MVP by building out an AngularJS app calling from an API crafted by our back-end team.  AngularJS is still intimidating, and sometimes I stare at my screen wondering why I'm getting these errors.  It's kind of funny to think that just a few weeks ago, I dreaded getting errors in the console. Now when I see them, I find myself saying "Good! That narrows it down."  That's the kind of attitude that will get you through any blocker you have. Googling doesn't hurt either! </p>

          <small>21 March 2016</small>
          <p class = "blog-content">Last week we were introduced to the framework AngularJS!  Today, I just updated my blog with some AngularJS routing.  When I first learned JavaScript and jQuery, I primarily used <em>window.location</em> to redirect you from page to page.   Now that I have AngularJS on my blog, it is now a single page app with those pages now as partials.  I am hoping to incorporate more changes with AngularJS as I continue to explore it throughout these next few weeks.</p>

          <h2 class = "blog-title">Dear Future Bootcampers</h2>
          <small>17 March 2016</small>
          <p class = "blog-content">Today there was a meeting for prospective students at my campus.  I met a few curious minds who were eager to hear about my experience and my peers experiences before and during this process.  It had occured to me that I started this blog without mentioning why I decided to go down this journey in the first place.  I thought I should share my own experience starting from my decision to go into a bootcamp and choosing the right one for me.</p>
          <p class = "blog-content"><strong>Why Bootcamp?</strong> Everyone has their own reason as to why they want to go to bootcamp, whether it be for personal enrichment, a complete career change, or using skills they acquire here for their own startup.  Whatever it it may be, choosing the right bootcamp is one's own personal journey. My personal reason: career change.  The previous company I had worked for had contracted a company to develop an app for them. Being able to create it myself, rather than just speak about what I thought it should do and have someone else interpret it, seemed much more interesting to me.  Like many others,  I explored this interest though meetups, weekend and night classes and online tutorials. However, I wanted a career change and real world experience with developers.  Bootcamp seemed like the next step into my newfound career, a decision I am glad I made. </p>
          <p class = "blog-content"><strong>Which Bootcamp?</strong>  When I was "bootcamp shopping", I utilized resources like <a href = "http://www.coursereport.com">Course Report</a> and <a href = "http://www.switchup.org">SwitchUp</a>.  Those were great, but seeing the bootcamps in person, meeting the instructors, and getting feedback from current students or alumni were invaluable in making my decision.  This is an investment in your time and money, and you want to make sure it's worth it.  What I've found is that generally bootcamps across the country have similar curriculum and a lot of the same philosophies.  But the people behind it such as the instructors, administrators, and even board members make all the difference.  You want to know who is teaching you and how they will be teaching.  These past few weeks have been exceptionally difficult, but also equally enriching and fulfilling.  I don't know that I would have learned this much or made it this far if it weren't for my instructor.  During the bootcamp interview process, interview your instructors and make sure they are a great fit for you too.</p>
          <p class = "blog-content">Good luck on your bootcamp journey!</p>

          <small>14 March 2016</small>
          <p class = "blog-content">Officially halfway done with bootcamp! Last week was a whirlwind.  We started out with a pair project, working with the framework <a href="http://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and some APIs.  My partner and I worked on creating a chat app that allows the user to run a command when using the '@' or ampersand character. Long story short, we developed our chat app with some technical difficulties from Vue.js, so we ended up rebuilding it in jQuery. jQuery, I still love you. </p>
          <p class = "blog-content">This weekend, our cohort worked on a group project across the Front-End and Ruby on Rails classes.  This was my first introduction to rails and the rails asset pipeline.  Was it scary? You bet.  Was it frustrating? Absolutely.  Was it the most fun i've ever had on a project? 100% yes.  I was impressed with how well we planned, organized and deployed our first fullstack project.  Everyone in bootcamp is hardworking and has grit, but not everyone in the world can be empathetic or patient. Our group shined in all aspects. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0">Google</a>, we're coming for you!</p>

          <small>05 March 2016</small>
          <p class = "blog-content">A few weeks ago, I started bootcamp. Not a "bootcamp" in the traditional sense, but most definitely a bootcamp. For the past 5 weeks, The Iron Yard Academy has been my home, mostly because i've been all but slept here these past few weeks, but partly because these people end up becoming your fellow wonderfully nerdy, cat-meme loving family.  So what have I struggled through and what have I done so far?
          Well, let me put this in an unordered list for you. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>HTML: the skeleton, the king! I enjoy how literal it is.  It has been a great foray into coding and after a few weeks of practicing, I feel as though this hypertext markup language and I are now best friends.  I also enjoy using geolocation in HTML5 and one day I hope to feel the same for localStorage. One day.</li>
              <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is both beautiful and beautifully hacky.  I enjoy making web pages centered, adding media queries in and looking at how responsive my work can be, and playing around with it's simpler but sleeker sister pre-processer, Sass.  We also looked into Twitter's popular framework, Bootstrap. Due to my time constraints, and the fact that I would like to get back to doing my assignment, I used Bootstrap to create this quick and easy blog in just a few minutes!</li>
              <li>JavaScript: Ah, this is truly the heart of the course. We've become familiar with Vanilla JavaScript; from functions, methods and objects, arrays and loops, we
              have practiced them all.  The daily coding challenges can be intimidating, but they are great practice. Then, we learned jQuery and wondered what we have been doing all our lives. jQuery, I love you.</li>
            </ul>
